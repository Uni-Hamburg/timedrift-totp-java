# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

## Asking for help

You can use the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Uni-Hamburg/timedrift-totp-java/discussions) to get help using this library.

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Uni-Hamburg/timedrift-totp-java/issues)
    * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
    * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
    * This is usually the master branch.
    * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
      <branch name> master`. By convention we typically include the GitHub issue
      key in the branch name, e.g. `1234-my-feature`.
    * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Follow the coding style in use.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository

## Reviewing changes

* After submitting a pull request, one of AeroGear team members will review it.
* Changes may be requested to conform to our style guide and internal
  requirements.
* When the changes are approved and all tests are passing, a AeroGear team
  member will merge them.
* Note: if you have write access to the repository, do not directly merge pull
  requests. Let another team member review your pull request and approve it.
